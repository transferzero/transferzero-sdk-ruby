  # unit tests for post_transactions
  # Creates a new transaction
  # Transactions are the main objects in the TransferZero API, so it&#39;s important to understand how to create and manage them. Transactions facilitate money movement from one Sender in a specific currency to one or multiple Recipients in another currency.  The main flow of a successful transaction flow is the following - - Transaction is created linking the Sender to the Recipient(s) with the requested amounts. - Once the sender is KYC&#39;d and approved the transaction can be funded. - Once the transaction is funded, we will initiate the payout to the recipient(s). - After the recipient (or all recipients) has received the money, the transaction is finished.
